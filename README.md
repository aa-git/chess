this is to simulate the possible ways an initial game of chess can lead to checkmate.  
The initial config is stored in an excel file, inclosed in a box of '*' (stars)  
0 is black, 1 is white, and piece names are  
    PAWN (P)  
	ROOK (R)  
    KING (K)  
	QUEEN (Q)  
	BISHOP (B)  
	KNIGHT (K)  
eg: 1Q means queen of color white
